# 🎾 Elm Tennis 2026

Elm Tennis 2026 is a small Elm application that models and displays a single tennis match between two players. It focuses on accurate tennis scoring logic — games, sets, tiebreaks, and match completion — using Elm's strong type system and pure functions.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Two-player tennis match**
- **Accurate scoring logic**:
  - Love → 15 → 30 → 40 → Deuce → Advantage → Game
  - Win a set by 2 games (e.g. 6–4) or 7–5
  - Tiebreak at 6–6 (first to 7, win by 2)
- **Match results**:
  - Best-of-3 or Best-of-5 sets (configured at match start)
  - Automatically detects winner
- **UI elements**:
  - Shows set scores and current game score
  - Shows “Ad” and “40” correctly during advantage
  - Highlights set winners in the scoreboard
  - “Player 1 Scores”, “Player 2 Scores” buttons
  - “New Match” button when finished
- **Pure Elm — no ports, no JavaScript interop**

## 🗂 Project Structure

```
src/
  Main.elm        -- Model, update logic, and view
```

The entire application currently exists in a single file. View refactoring and module separation are planned for the future.

---

## ▶ How to Run

### Option 1: elm reactor (quickest)

```bash
elm reactor
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/` and click `src/Main.elm`.

### Option 2: Compile to HTML

```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output=index.html
```
Then open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🎮 How Scoring Works

| Level   | Rules                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Game    | Love → 15 → 30 → 40 → Deuce → Ad → Game                               |
| Set     | First to 6, must win by 2 (6–4, 7–5) or tiebreak at 6–6               |
| Match   | Best-of-3 sets (first to 2 sets wins the match)                      |
| Tiebreak| First to 7, must win by 2 (score shown like `7–6 (7–4)` internally)   |

---

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Split logic and view into separate modules (e.g. `View/Scoreboard.elm`)
- Expose Best-of-3 or Best-of-5 configuration in the UI (currently only internal code setting)
- Save match progress to local storage
- Add styling or animations
- Unit tests for scoring functions

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is both a working tennis scorer and a learning exercise in Elm — emphasizing readability, pure functions, and refactoring over time.
